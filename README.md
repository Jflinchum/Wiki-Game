# Wiki-Game

This app generates a random path from one random wiki article to another. The goal of the game is to find the shortest path
between two articles. You can give an initial article to start on, or give a goal article to try to find a path to. 

You can also input two articles, which will generate the shortest path between them. This is currently not optimized well and will take too long on a path greater than 3.
